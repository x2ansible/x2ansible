# Concepts

Understanding the architecture, agents, and workflow of X2A Convertor.

## Overview

X2A Convertor uses a multi-agent AI architecture built on LangGraph to analyze legacy infrastructure code and generate modern Ansible playbooks. The system is designed around two primary agent types:

- **Input Agents (Analysis)**: Understand and document source configurations
- **Export Agents (Migration)**: Generate and validate target Ansible code
